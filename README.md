# SymPhoX

SymPhoX is a Python toolkit for reading, preparing, and visualising
PicoQuant SymPhoTime 64 `.dat` files for quantitative fluorescence
lifetime and TCSPC analysis.

The package is designed for researchers working with FLIM and related
time-resolved fluorescence data who want reproducible, scriptable
workflows outside proprietary software.

## Features

- Import SymPhoTime 64 `.dat` files
- Extract photon, lifetime, and metadata information
- Prepare data for downstream analysis and plotting
- Generate publication-ready visualisations
- Designed to integrate with custom FLIM and FRET pipelines
